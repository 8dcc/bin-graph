* Description

This program provides a simple way of visualizing the different regions of a
binary file.

* Building

The program depends on =libpng= for exporting the image. Install it from your
package manager.

#+begin_src bash
# Arch-based distros
pacman -S libpng

# Gentoo
emerge media-libs/libpng
#+end_src

Once all the dependencies are installed, compile the program.

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/8dcc/bin-graph
$ cd bin-graph
$ make
...
#+end_src

* Usage

#+begin_src console
$ ./bin-graph <input> <output.png>
...
#+end_src
